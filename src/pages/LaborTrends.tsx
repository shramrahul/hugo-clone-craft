            The November BLS jobs data, following the October BLS data which was negatively impacted by hurricane and strike anomalies, follows the pattern seen throughout much of 2024. We are experiencing a "soft landing" with a slightly cooling economy. This was the Federal Reserve's goalâ€”to begin an easing cycle. The labor markets remain very much intact, as demonstrated by a still historically low unemployment rate.

              Once the macro uncertainties begin to clear, we expect clients to initiate their backlog of high-priority technology initiatives at an accelerated pace. As Avega COO recently commented, "Clients' prolonged caution in initiating new investments has resulted in an increasingly strong backlog of strategically imperative technology investments. We believe this backlog may be a high priority for our clients to initiate at an accelerated pace as macro uncertainties begin to clear in 2025."
            </p>
            <p>
              Avega CEO emphasized that, over the long term, advancements in AI and other innovative technologies are likely to follow the historic pattern where increased efficiency leads to greater demand for technology resources rather than replacing them, and that the pace of change will continue to accelerate.
            </p>
            <p>
              Avega is ideally positioned to meet this eventual demand. While finalizing technology plans for 2025, clients would be well served to partner with their Avega experts as they prepare to tackle key technology initiatives.
